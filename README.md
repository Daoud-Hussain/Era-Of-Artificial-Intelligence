# Era of Artificial Intelligence
## Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that has become increasingly important in the modern era. It involves the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

The importance of AI in the modern era can be seen in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, and entertainment. In healthcare, AI is used for medical imaging, disease diagnosis, and drug discovery, which has significantly improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

In finance, AI is used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and risk management, which has increased the efficiency and accuracy of financial services. In transportation, AI is used for self-driving cars, traffic management, and logistics, which has improved safety, reduced traffic congestion, and increased delivery efficiency.

In manufacturing, AI is used for predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization, which has reduced downtime, improved product quality, and increased productivity. In entertainment, AI is used for personalized recommendations, content creation, and game development, which has enhanced user experiences and increased engagement.

Moreover, AI has the potential to address some of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare disparities. For instance, AI can be used to optimize energy consumption, improve disaster response, and provide access to healthcare in underserved communities.

In summary, the importance of AI in the modern era cannot be overstated. It has transformed various industries and has the potential to address global challenges, which makes it an essential tool for creating a better future.

## Summary

Keeping in mind all this rise in Artificial Intelligence, we'll discuss all the major resources in this repo where you can learn AI and bright your future as an **ML or DL Engineer**.
